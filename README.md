## What is Friendzy?

Ever wanted to hang out with friends, but could never quite seem to get everyone together? Tired of plans never escaping the confines of the group chat? We're building a bridge between text and real life with Friendzy, an app designed to help groups figure out when to meet up. Users fill out their schedule with their work, classes, events, hangouts, etc. Their friends can then view that schedule and request to hang out by adding shared events. Most importantly, Friendzy integrates these calendar functions with the key features of common social media platforms, such as friend lists, home feeds, messaging, and media sharing, so it can offer a far warmer and more personal user experience than preexisting calendar apps like Google Calendar.

Friendzy offers scheduling support for larger groups as well. Organizations can see their users' availability as heatmaps (with members' permission) and schedule events accordingly, which users can then find and RSVP for. Those who have attended events will also be able to see who else attended, and receive notifications about future events. Thus, while Friendzy is mainly designed to be used with friends (as the name implies), it's also something people can use to connect with -- or build -- a larger community.


## Features offered

Friendzy is a fully fledged calendar app, with the usual functions a calendar app would have:

- Daily/weekly/monthly views
- .ical integration so users can upload already-created schedules
- Schedule filtering based on parameters such as time of day, users attending the event, etc.
- Recurring events
- etc.

Friendzy also supports key social media app functions:

- Rich user presences with nicknames, profile pictures, profiles ("bios"), birthday/anniversary information, etc.
- Messaging
- Media sharing support for videos, pictures, etc. up to a certain size
- Group chats
- Friend lists
- Home feeds (publicly posted media, group events, etc)

However, Friendzy sets itself apart from preexisting social media and calendar apps:

- Seamless integration of calendar and social media functions (i.e., displaying combined calendars based on the group chat currently open)
- Advanced privacy settings: set events or calendars to be visible only to specific categories of users, which can be user-defined (i.e., "band mates" or "English presentation group") or predefined (private, friends, groups, public, etc.).
- Mobile/web notifications for new events, upcoming events, event invitations, etc.
